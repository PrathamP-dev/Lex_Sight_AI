# Important Security Upgrade Required

## Current Status
Your Supabase integration is functional but uses the **anon key** which is designed for client-side access with Row Level Security (RLS). Since this app uses custom session-based authentication (not Supabase Auth), we cannot use RLS policies effectively.

## Security Issue
The anon key approach has a vulnerability: if the key is exposed, attackers could bypass your application and query the database directly. While the key is currently server-side only, this is not ideal for production.

## Recommended Solution: Use Service Role Key

### What is a Service Role Key?
- A Supabase service role key is meant for **trusted server environments**
- It bypasses RLS and is designed for server-side operations
- It's the proper key to use when you have custom authentication

### How to Get Your Service Role Key

1. Go to [Supabase Dashboard](https://supabase.com/dashboard)
2. Select your project: `wwmizwjumyfxmrbqcoms`
3. Go to **Settings** → **API**
4. Under "Project API keys", find the **service_role** key (it's longer than the anon key)
5. Copy this key

### Update the Configuration

Once you have the service role key, let me know and I'll update the app to use it instead of the anon key.

## Alternative: Keep Current Setup (Not Recommended for Production)

If this is just for development/testing, the current setup works with these limitations:
- ✅ All database operations go through authenticated API routes
- ✅ Session authentication protects your app
- ⚠️ Database is vulnerable if the anon key leaks
- ⚠️ Not suitable for production with sensitive data

## Current Database Schema

The database schema (supabase-schema.sql) has RLS disabled because it doesn't work with custom auth. Once you provide the service role key, the security model will be:
- **Service role key** = Full database access (server-side only)
- **API routes** = Validate sessions before database operations  
- **Middleware** = Protects routes and ensures users are authenticated

This is the standard approach for apps with custom authentication using Supabase as a database.
